# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

  The idea for 'Trapped In The Laundromat' sparked from a initial burst of creativity where a friend wished for an idea for their game and I immediately said, "Trapped In The Dryer", not knowing what would come of it, but only to give her an idea. This we both found to be a very exciting proposal. She took upon herself said idea to work with, and so I was left to make the sequel, 'Trapped In The Laundromat'. It follows what comes after you leave the confines of the dryer and just want to go home, but the laundromat has more in store. From wild beasts to ghosts and some strange characters along the way, 'Trapped In The Laundromat' leads you through the aftermath of an earthquake in which the laundromat has split into several levels and must be passed before you can make your escape. It is a game with a fixed storyline where only minor changes can be made to the proceedings of the player's escape, but they can have a big impact on how fast, if ever, the game is completed. With everything to lose, the player must go on a slightly nostalgic and humorous journey to end their nightmare in their local laundromat.
